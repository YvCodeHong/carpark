# Carpark

## Summary

This is my response to the carpark challenge set by Makers Academy.

In this challenge, it asks for us to build an application that manages a car park,
including monitoring the number of cars parked and calculating parking charges.
Ideally your app could be re-used, to manage car parks with different capabilities.
